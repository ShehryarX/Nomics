# Nomics
This project is a submission to Hacking Good Toronto 2017 (https://devpost.com/software/nomics). Hopefully we can win the second stage of pitches next week!

## Inspiration
Our inspiration encompasses games like Cookie Clicker, which are highly addictive, but undeniable simple.

## What it does
Our Android/iOS app teaches our generation's youth about financial literacy through a life simulation. This life simulation involves going to school, where you formally learn from professionals in the finance industry, making crucial financial decisions such as choosing credit cards, and competing with friends to see who is the most financially literate.

## How we built it
We built this project three times in 24 hours... The React Native version went pretty well; Ionic, not so much.

## Challenges we ran into
- Being early enough to the hackathon
- componentWillMount on React Native

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of everything we have done to be frank.

## What we learned
We learned to not use Ionic for hackathons again.

## What's next for Nomics
We plan to lunch this as an app on the Play Store and iOS Market to allow everyone to access it.
